# Libft - Your very first own library

Libft is a project that requires us to re-create standard C library functions according to the WeThinkCode_ standards, also known as "The Norm". This library helps to understand the concepts of static libraries in C programming and also serves as a handy utility package for future C projects at WeThinkCode_.
